PCA Algorithm

Principal Component Analysis is a very useful method to analyze numerical data structured in a M observations / N variables table. It allows to:

Quickly visualize and analyze correlations between the N variables,
Visualize and analyze the M observations (initially described by the N variables) on a low dimensional map, the optimal view for a variability criterion,
Build a set of P uncorrelated factors
The limits of Principal Component Analysis stem from the fact that it is a projection method, and sometimes the visualization can lead to false interpretations. There are however some tricks to avoid these pitfalls.

It is also important to note that PCA is an exploratory statistical tool and does not generally allow to test hypotheses. The advantage of this aspect is that PCA's may be run several times with observations or variables being removed or added at every run, as long as those manipulations are justified in the interpretations.

The data are from the US Census Bureau and describe the changes in the population of 51 states between 2000 and 2001. The initial dataset has been transformed to rates per 1000 inhabitants, with the data for 2001 serving as the focus for the analysis. This dataset is also used in our
